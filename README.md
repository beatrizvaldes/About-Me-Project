# About Me Project

Welcome to the About Me project. 
This is a project for Coding 201 lab.
In this website, you are going to know a little more about me with funny little questions in form of **promps** and **alerts**. Each day the questions keeps getting harder, so beware. 
I hope you have a great time getting to know me better!
